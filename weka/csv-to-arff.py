# Converts comma separated value (CSV) files 
# to Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF).
# where 'converts' means that an arff file is created and populated with
# the csv data. The csv file is not deleted or modified.

# @Description
# Simple python program that reads a csv file, selects all its attributes 
# and assigns its data type ("numeric" or "nominal").
# Selects unique data values for each nominal attribute, and 
# inserts a '0' on each empty cell.
#
# This program was made to facilitate some csv data cleaning when I was
# trying to open a csv file in Weka, for a school research project.
# This program helps to clean the csv file by converting it to arff format
# when the csv file has some inconsistencies, such as having numeric and 
# nominal values for the same attribute values, and when it has empty cells.
#
# @About the ARFF format and Weka Software
# ARFF file format is used with Weka, a machine learning software from the
# University of Waikato. Information about the ARFF file and Weka is on the
# University of Waikato website: https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/arff.html
#
#
# Note:
# You can open the arff file with a text editor
#
